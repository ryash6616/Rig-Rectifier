                The AMD Ryzen family is an x86-64 microprocessor family from
                AMD, based on the Zen microarchitecture. The Ryzen lineup
                includes Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7, Ryzen 9, and Ryzen
                Threadripper with up to 64 cores. All consumer Ryzens have an
                unlocked multiplier and all support Simultaneous Multithreading
                (SMT) except earlier Zen/Zen+ based desktop Ryzen 3 and
                Zen/Zen+/Zen 2 (Lucienne excluded) based mobile Ryzen 3. the AMD
                Ryzen 5000 series of processors have been gracing us with its
                presence for some time now. Its mid-range and high-end CPUs, in
                fact, are already powering such popular desktop PCs as the
                Alienware R10 Ryzen Edition and a gaming laptop such as the ASUS
                ROG Zephyrus Duo SE, as there’s a big focus for this
                newly-launched lineup of processors on gaming. With the AMD
                Ryzen 5000 CPUs, AMD has finally dethroned Intel when it comes
                to raw gaming performance. The new CPU lineup is led by the AMD
                Ryzen 9 5950X, a high-end chip packed with 16 cores and 32
                threads, with a whopping 4.9GHz boost clock. That's a pretty
                massive generational leap over the Ryzen 9 3950X already, before
                you consider the boost to IPC (instructions per clock)
                performance, thanks to the massive Zen 3 redesign.AMD has had
                several products with Zen 3, including the regular Ryzen 5000
                and EPYC 7003 processor lineups, and 5000G will take on the same
                feature set.
